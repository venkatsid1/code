Concepts
========================
IOC or Dependency Injection
	Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) are used interchangeably. IOC is achieved through DI. 
	DI is the process of providing the dependencies and IOC is the end result of DI.

	By DI the responsibility of creating objects is shifted from our application code to Spring container hence the phenomenon is called IOC.

	Dependency Injection can be done by setter injection, constructor injection.
