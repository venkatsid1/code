File Compression
	http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-6-x/topics/admin_data_compression_performance.html
    GZIP is uses more CPU resource than snappy and LZO which provides higher compression ratio.
	GZIP is good for cold data. Snappy or LZO are good for hot data.
	BZip2 provides more compression than GZIP for some type of files, but consume time while compress/decompress. HBase does not support BZip2
	Snappy performs better than LZO (Developer needs to test and decide)
	BZip2 and LZO are splittable. While Snappy and GZIP blocks are not splittable, but Snappy blocks inside container file formats like Avro and SequentialFile can be split.
    Snappy is intended to be used inside Avro and SequentialFile.
    MR can compress intermediate or output or both data.
